> ‚ö†Ô∏è Evolving API: Kubricate has been tested in internal environments and many parts are stable with test coverage. However, the project is still evolving as we design use cases around real-world Kubernetes pain points.
>
> Kubricate is not here to replace the great tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem‚Äîbut to improve the developer experience around YAML templating, type safety, and reuse.
> 
> Expect frequent API changes. Please follow [issues](https://github.com/thaitype/kubricate/issues) for proposed features and [pull requests](https://github.com/thaitype/kubricate/pulls) for updates on documentation and migration plans.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üì¶ Type-safe Kubernetes Manifest Generation**: Define Kubernetes resources using fully-typed TypeScript objects ‚Äî with support for reuse, composition, and validation in your IDE.

- **üß± Stack-Based Architecture**: Group related resources together into reusable **Stacks** ‚Äî such as `Deployment + Service`, or `Namespace + RoleBinding`. Easily parameterize and extend them across environments.

- **üîê Declarative Secret Management**: Declare secrets with `addSecret({ name })`, and hydrate them from multiple backends like `.env`, Azure Key Vault, 1Password, or Vault ‚Äî all within your CI/CD pipeline.

<!-- ### üîÑ Secret Hydration Plans  
Define **hydration plans** to control where secrets come from and where they go ‚Äî perfect for syncing between `.env` ‚Üí Azure KV or Vault ‚Üí K8s Secrets. -->

- **‚ôªÔ∏è Connectors and Providers**: Use **Connectors** to read/write secrets from systems, and **Providers** to convert secrets into Kubernetes-native resources (like `Secret`, `ConfigMap`, or `ExternalSecret`).

- **üöÄ CLI-Friendly & GitOps Ready**: Run `kubricate generate` <!--,  `kubricate secrets hydrate`, --> and `kubricate secrets plan` to validate, sync, and render your infrastructure as YAML ‚Äî without running anything in your cluster.

- **üß™ First-Class Dev Experience**: Enjoy full IDE autocomplete, refactor support, type checking, and linting across your entire platform configuration ‚Äî all in TypeScript.


## üß≠ Motivation

### üí• The Problem

Secret management in Kubernetes is fragmented, repetitive, and error-prone. In production environments, teams often deal with:

- Manually duplicating `Secret` manifests across environments
- Templating secret references with Helm or Kustomize
- Managing complex `ExternalSecret` or `Vault` annotations spread across YAML files
- Relying on runtime injectors or sidecars with unclear debugging paths
- No clear way to track which secrets are used, where they come from, or who owns them

These patterns result in:

- ‚ùå Too much untyped YAML
- ‚ùå Difficult-to-test deployments
- ‚ùå Poor visibility into secret flow
- ‚ùå Secrets being treated as runtime config, not infrastructure

### üîç Existing Solutions (and Limitations)

| Tool                    | Strengths                                   | Weaknesses                                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **External Secrets Operator (ESO)** | Reconciles secrets from cloud backends | Heavy YAML usage, CRDs, hard to reuse or test                 |
| **Vault Agent Injector** | Dynamic injection at runtime                | Requires sidecars, annotations, Vault policy setup             |
| **SOPS / Sealed Secrets** | GitOps-safe encryption                     | Complex rotation/versioning, no unified source of truth        |
| **Helm values + `.env`** | Familiar templating                         | No type safety, validation, or traceability                    |


### üí° Kubricate‚Äôs Approach

Kubricate doesn't replace those tools ‚Äî it replaces the **YAML, glue logic, and guesswork** needed to make them work.

Instead of defining secrets across many `values.yaml`, CRDs, and annotations, Kubricate gives you:

- ‚úÖ Type-safe secret declarations in code: `addSecret({ name: 'API_KEY' })`
- ‚úÖ Secret hydration plans that describe where secrets come from and where they go
- ‚úÖ Plug-in **Connectors** to load secrets from `.env`, 1Password, Vault, or any backend
- ‚úÖ The ability to generate YAML, `ExternalSecret` CRDs, or annotations with confidence

Kubricate focuses on **design-time control**, not runtime magic:
- You define the truth in TypeScript
- You hydrate secrets as part of your pipeline
- You generate manifests, not YAML by hand

Whether you're using ArgoCD, ESO, Vault, or no controller at all ‚Äî Kubricate makes the configuration safe, testable, and understandable by everyone on your team.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -D kubricate
npm install @kubricate/core
```

If you want Kubernetes resource types in TypeScript, install `kubernetes-models`. It helps generate fully-typed resource objects.

```bash
npm install -D kubernetes-models
```

Then, create your first Kubricate Stack. Kubricate Stacks help you define, reuse, and manage Kubernetes resources in a clean, declarative way.

### üß± Example: Creating a Namespace Stack

```ts
// File: src/my-stack.ts
import { createStack, ResourceComposer } from '@kubricate/core';
import { Namespace } from 'kubernetes-models/v1';

// Step 1: declare data schema
interface MyInput {
  name: string;
}

// Step 2: define stack shape for reusable work
const MyStack = createStack('MyStack', (data: MyInput) =>
  new ResourceComposer().addClass({
    id: 'namespace',
    type: Namespace,
    config: {
      metadata: { name: data.name },
    },
  })
);

// Usage: configure the stack with your own input
envexport const myStack = MyStack.from({
  name: 'my-namespace',
});
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure with `kubricate.config.ts`

Create a `kubricate.config.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'kubricate';
import { myStack } from './src/MyStack';

export default defineConfig({
  stacks: {
    myStack,
  },
});
```

### üöÄ Generate Kubernetes Resources

```bash
npx kubricate generate
```

This will generate Kubernetes YAML files in the `.kubricate` folder:

```bash
‚úî YAML file successfully written to:
  ~/with-custom-stack/.kubricate/stacks.yml
```

See the full working example: [`with-custom-stack`](https://github.com/thaitype/kubricate/tree/main/examples/with-custom-stack)

Kubricate offers a type-safe developer experience for building Kubernetes manifests. It works with your existing resources, supports secret injection through connectors like `EnvConnector`, and prevents exposing secrets in YAML.
